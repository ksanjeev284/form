Here is a simple python program that creates a form and stores all the entered value into a csv file. 
Try running the program to understand it's working better.

If you are intested in improving this project, here are some to do's:

 * Checking if the phone number entered is a valid number by
 ensuring only digits are entered and
 Only 10 digits are entered 

 * Check if the e-mail is valid by checking for a "@" symbol.

 * Display an error messagebox after any invalid input and allow the user to edit their input without terminating program execution.

 * Any other suggesions you have to improve this project are welcome.
:-)
